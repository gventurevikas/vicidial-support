- **Disk Space**: Alert when <20% free space remaining
- **Database**: Alert when connection pool >90% utilized

### 1.3 Load Balancing Considerations
- Distribute calls across multiple servers
- Implement failover mechanisms
- Monitor server health in real-time
- Scale resources based on call volume

## 2. Caller ID Health and Rotation Management

### 2.1 Caller ID Health Monitoring

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure caller IDs meet local regulations

### 2.2 When to Rotate Caller IDs
**Immediate Rotation Triggers:**
- Answer rate drops below 15%
- Block rate exceeds 5%
- Customer complaints increase significantly
- Regulatory violations detected
- Carrier blocks or restrictions

**Proactive Rotation Schedule:**
- High-volume campaigns: Every 24-48 hours
- Medium-volume campaigns: Every 3-5 days
- Low-volume campaigns: Every 7-10 days

### 2.3 Caller ID Rotation Frequency Guidelines

#### 2.3.1 Volume-Based Rotation
- **High Volume (>1000 calls/day)**: Rotate every 24-48 hours
- **Medium Volume (100-1000 calls/day)**: Rotate every 3-5 days
- **Low Volume (<100 calls/day)**: Rotate every 7-10 days

#### 2.3.2 Performance-Based Rotation
- **Excellent Performance**: Extend rotation cycle by 50%
- **Good Performance**: Maintain standard rotation schedule
- **Poor Performance**: Reduce rotation cycle by 50%

#### 2.3.3 Industry-Specific Guidelines
- **Healthcare**: Rotate every 24-48 hours (strict compliance)
- **Financial Services**: Rotate every 24-72 hours
- **Retail/General**: Rotate every 3-7 days

- **Transfer Rate**: Track successful transfers to agents

### 3.4 List Management Best Practices
- Implement list scoring based on historical performance
- Use predictive dialing to optimize list usage
- Monitor list fatigue and implement rest periods
- Track list source quality and performance

## 4. Campaign Performance Management

### 4.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Answer Rate**: Percentage of answered calls
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of successful outcomes
- **Agent Utilization**: Agent productivity and efficiency
- **Cost per Acquisition**: Campaign cost effectiveness
- **Revenue per Call**: Campaign profitability

### 4.2 Campaign Optimization
- **Time-of-Day Optimization**: Schedule calls during peak hours
- **Day-of-Week Optimization**: Focus on high-performing days
- **Geographic Optimization**: Target high-performing regions
